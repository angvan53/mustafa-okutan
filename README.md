## 💬 Why I Built This Page

I created this GitHub page to **document solutions, provide reusable templates, and help others deploy faster on AWS.**  
Many AWS tutorials focus on theory; here, I focus on **practical implementations and lessons learned from real deployments.**

> "The best way to learn something is to teach it." – *Richard Feynman*
